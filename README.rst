Stuff to Do 
-------------------------------------
1. Collision detection between user and hedges/finish/edge of platform 

2. Abstract the levels (start level, set up level, next level)

3. Animate something (falling off the platform)

4. Add two lights (one in the sky and the other will be the user ball)

5. Two shader programs
   i. Color the ball as the position changes
   ii. Another one using the fragment shader
