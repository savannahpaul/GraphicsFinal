Stuff to Do 
-------------------------------------
1. Update user heading to match platform orientation 

2. Collision detection between user and hedges

3. Create a goal for the user to reach (animate the win) 

4. Abstract the levels (start level, set up level, next level)

5. Animate something (falling off the platform)

6. Use the other shader program on objects in scene 

7. Add two lights (one in the sky and the other will be the user ball)

8. Two shader programs
   i. Color the ball as the position changes
   ii. Another one using the fragment shader
